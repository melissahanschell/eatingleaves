          <h3>About The Eating Leaves Shop</h3>
          <p>
          <p class="lead">Welcome to the Eating Leaves store! I can't tell you how happy I am that you're here exploring this journey with me. This shop has been a work in progress for a few months now, so I'm so excited that this baby has finally materialized and taken off.
          <p>The whole purpose of starting a shop on my blog was to not only help inspire others to eat well, but to also convince them that "healthy" doesn't have to be a bad word. It's not about banning everything and anything that tastes good, but about finding that balanced solution to, yes, have your cake and eat it too. Pure Utopia.
          <p>What you'll find in the Eating Leaves shop are a handful of handmade, vegan treats that are refined sugar free, trans fat free, cholesterol free, and made with natural and organic ingredients, making them the smarter choice for you and your family. My goal is to save you time and energy in the kitchen by offering more dependable snack options, so you can spend more time with the people you love and less time worrying about whether or not eating that cookie is actually a good idea.
          <p>What you'll also notice is that the Eating Leaves shop isn't full of an overwhelmingly number of items. This is done on purpose to not only keep things simple for the customer, but to also provide the best quality and service at the same time. I am so confident in the quality of these items that I know once you introduce one into your life, you'll keep wanting more.
          <p>Time is precious, so don't let it go to waste. Invest in your health as you would your time.
