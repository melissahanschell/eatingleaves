          <h2>About Melissa</h2>
          <p class="lead">If there's one thing you need to know about me it's that I absolutely, positively love food, and all kinds of it. 
          <p>Growing up in a family of meat lovers it wasn't exactly easy to eat many greens or veggies. It wasn't until I looked at myself in the mirror and decided that my diet needed to change, or else I was going to go down a bad, or should I say, round path. It wasn't only my physical appearance I needed to work on, it was my energy levels and overall mood that needed to change. I had been completely oblivious about nutrition and diet for over 20 years. 
          <p>It wasn't until I began educating myself on the importance of organic healthy eating that my mind became clearer and my waist became smaller. I think like a lot of people, I didn't know that healthy food could be enjoyable to eat. And that's where the inspiration to start eating leaves came from: to let average, everyday people, like me, know that you can make flavorful, yet affordable food that is good for you, while feeling good about yourself in the process.
          <p>Creating these recipes also inspired me to open a little shop that offered my all time favourite vegan snacks and desserts. After months of trial and error sessions in the kitchen, I finally decided on eight different products that are not only super delicious, but healthy and guilt-free to eat as well. Made with organic ingredients and natural sweeteners, you won't believe they're good for you.
          <p>With that being said, I hope you also stay a while, browse through some of my recipes and make something for yourself and others in the process. You'll be amazed at what you can gain by eating leaves.
          <p>Feel free to connect with me through Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus or Instagram - or send me an email at info@eatingleaves.com with any questions or special orders. I can't wait to eat well with you! :)
          <p>- Melissa xo
